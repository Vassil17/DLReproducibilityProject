# FCNs in the Wild: Reproducibility Project for Deep Learning
## Introduction:
In this blog post we will first introduce the paper that we were tasked with reproducing, namely FCNs in the Wild: Pixel-level Adversarial and Constraint-based Adaptation.
We will go through the main concepts behind pixel-level image segmentation and domain adaptation. We will then explain the existing code implementations (one in PyTorch and
one in TensorFlow).
